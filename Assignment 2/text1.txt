The MOE has given out a total of 420 teaching scholarships and 
awards, the highest number of scholarships and awards given out 
since 2003.

MOE said that it has a bumper harvest this year because of the 
strong interest in teaching among quality candidates.

Four candidates have been awarded the prestigious Overseas Merit 
Scholarships for Teaching by the Public Service Commission, 
while 17 others have been given the coveted Education Merit 
Scholarship.

MOE said it is also extending more Masters sponsorship 
opportunities for outstanding teaching scholars and teaching 
applicants.

From 2010, top performing graduates from the Bachelor of 
Art/Science in Education in NIE will be eligible to pursue 
their Masters studies on MOE sponsorship immediately after 
their undergraduate studies.
