MORE roads will be closed for this year's NDP and preview than last year, 
for a first-ever march through the city by the entire parade contingent.

TP officers IC will also be stationed along the Benjamin Sheares Bridge. 
Motorists are advised not to stop there to watch the fireworks display. 
The bridge will be closed to pedestrians.

Vehicles parked illegally in the area will be towed away. Those parked 
at Marina Square should avoid exiting into Raffles Avenue from 2pm onwards.

As large crowds are anticipated in the area, the police advise the public 
to consider using alternative stations to City Hall MRT Station, such as 
Raffles Place, Clarke Quay and Bugis.

Police officers will regulate areas such as Esplanade Bridge and Merlion 
Park where those without tickets to the event can gather to watch the 
march and the fireworks display. They may stop people from going there 
if necessary to prevent overcrowding.
