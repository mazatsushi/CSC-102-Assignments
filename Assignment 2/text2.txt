LTA has started a project to widen the KJE between the BKE and PIE. 
I travel this road every morning and the plan to widen the KJE in 
direction of PIE will not reduce any congestion. Currently the 
congestion is caused by 3 lanes trying to squeeze into 2 lanes. 
Now there will be four lanes trying to get into 2 lanes. Very few 
vehicles use the KJE to get onto PIE to drive towards the city, 
most vehicles head to Tuas/Jurong.
